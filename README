In-memory Search engine

Your organization has started a new tech blog with interesting tech stories and youâ€™re responsible for designing and implementing an in-memory search engine, supporting the search functionality on the blog content.
It should be possible to create a dataset in the search engine.
It should be possible to insert documents into a given dataset. Each document is simply a piece of text.
It should be possible to search through documents for a search pattern in a given dataset
Examples
--------------
Search term: apple

Doc1: apple is a fruit
Doc2: apple apple come on.
Doc3: oranges are sour
Doc4: apple is sweet
Doc5: apple is sweet


Search results (number of occurrences of search term ranker)
[Doc2, Doc1, Doc4] or [Doc2, Doc4, Doc1]

Search results (recency ranker)
Doc 4, Doc2, Doc1 (creation)


1. can have duplicate documents in a dataset/org
2. would be mostly read heavy
3. based on create timestamp
4. string match ()


Methods:
1. createDataset(dataset_name)
2. createDocument(dataset_id, document_details)
3. searchDocument(search_string)

class Organisation:
    datasets: Dict[str: DataSet]

class DataSet:
    documents = {document_id: Document}
    idx =  {
    'apple' : [{document_id, creation_date, num_}, ],

    }

I is a apple

class Document:
    document_id :
    document_content
    created_at : timestamp
